Brand claims - brands whose representatives must sign off on changes to their data.

A maintainer records a claim in ``ofd/brand_claims.json`` once a brand has verified
who speaks for it. Any PR that touches ``data/<brand_id>/`` of a claimed brand then
needs an approving review from one of that brand's representatives on the PR's current
head commit (or must be authored by one) before the ``Brand sign-off`` status passes.

This module is pure logic; the GitHub I/O lives in ``ofd/commands/claims.py``.
